## Building_an_Awesome_Weather_App_using_OpenWeatherMap_API
This application makes a call by city name to the OpenWeatherMap API using Ajax to get current weather information in JSON format. However, the concept is equally relevant to using any API, but this app makes things a little bit easy because the user has just to type the name of a location and the results will be displayed in the page.    

### What is OpenWeatherMap API ?
OpenWeatherMap is an online service that provides global weather data via API, including current weather data, forecasts, nowcasts and historical weather data for any geographical location. When you want to play around with APIs, OpenWeatherMap is a great place to start and quite easy to work with as well. 

### What do you need ?
- The API key is all you need to call any of OpenWeatherMap APIs. For this application, we will be using the free current weather API. 
- Visit this [link](https://openweathermap.org/appid) and sign up for an account. All you need is an email address and password.
- Once you sign up using your email, the API key will be sent to you in a confirmation email. Your API key can always be found on your account page.
- Open index file and replace API key (line 222) with your unique API key.
- Run Django server and enjoy.
